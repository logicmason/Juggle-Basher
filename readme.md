This is the second flash game I wrote. It's a block bashing game like Arkanoid or Breakout. The spin I put on it is that it gives HUGE rewards for keeping a lot of balls in the air at once, thus the name Juggle Basher.  The artwork was easier than I'd expected, but the collision detection frustrated me for a whole day!  It was a good learning experience, though.

The some of the music files in this repo haven't been added to the game yet. Any that are added in any forks must be attributed to their authors.

You can see the game in action on my blog:
